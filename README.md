# Mira

# As time goes on and generations pass by each other, both society and its needs develop. 
# Therefore, we need to be constantly adapting to the change happening around us. 
# The mirror is an object that we use in everyday life that could use some adapting. 
# It performs a very simple function, one with no flair, yet it is one of the most commonly used objects in the world. 
# It is designed with only one purpose in mind: let the user see their reflection. 
# Despite the amount of time we spend looking in a mirror, it has not evolved or developed past this singular function. 

# We designed our product, Mira, to evolve the experience of using a mirror. 
# Our company's mantra is to create technology that advances along with society. 
# Our vision for the future includes the idea that every household is accustomed to having a Mira in their home.
